,PredefinedType,"Predefined generic type for a window that is specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given specificly for the predefined types.

 NOTE The PredefinedType shall only be used, if no IfcWindowType is assigned, providing its own IfcWindowType.PredefinedType.",IfcWindowTypeEnum,,?,,,,
,PartitioningType,"Type defining the general layout of the window in terms of the partitioning of panels.

 NOTE The PartitioningType shall only be used, if no type object IfcWindowType is assigned, providing its own IfcWindowType.PartitioningType.",IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum,,?,,,,

,ObjectPlacement,"Placement of the product in space, the placement can either be absolute (relative to the world coordinate system), relative (relative to the object placement of another product), or constraint (e.g. relative to grid axes). It is determined by the various subtypes of IfcObjectPlacement, which includes the axis placement information to determine the transformation for the object coordinate system.",IfcObjectPlacement,,?,,,,
,Representation,"Reference to the representations of the product, being either a representation (IfcProductRepresentation) or as a special case a shape representations (IfcProductDefinitionShape). The product definition shape provides for multiple geometric representations of the shape property of the object within the same object coordinate system, defined by the object placement.",IfcProductRepresentation,,?,,,,
