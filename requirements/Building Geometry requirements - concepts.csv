ifcObject,,An IfcObject is the generalization of any semantically treated thing or process. Objects are things as they appear - i.e. occurrences.
ifcProduct,,"The IfcProduct is an abstract representation of any object that relates to a geometric or spatial context. An IfcProduct occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The ObjectPlacement attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under Representation are founded. The Representation is provided by an IfcProductDefinitionShape being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items)."

A product can have zero, one or many geometric representations, and a single geometric representation can be shared among various products using mapped representations."

ifcClosedShell,,"A closed shell is a shell of the dimensionality 2 which typically serves as a bound for a region in R3. A closed shell has no boundary, and has non-zero finite extent. If the shell has a domain with coordinate space R3, it divides that space into two connected regions, one finite and the other infinite. In this case, the topological normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the infinite region."
ifcFace,,"An IfcFace is topological entity used to define surface, bounded by loops, of a shell."
